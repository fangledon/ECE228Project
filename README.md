# ECE228Project

This repo contains the code for the final project of ECE 228, which is solving waste classification problem using CNN models. Several self-built CNN models and SOTA models such as ResNet and DenseNet are used in this project. 

## Dependency
Pytorch, OpenCV, Numpy, sklearn

## Dataset
The dataset DATASET.zip can be accessed in the google drive:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/174um4-626FjRyGM0Qagg19lRTb7XXOpH/view?usp=sharing

After downloading the zip file, unzip it in the same folder as the repo. 

## Run the code
You can either download the notebook, and run it on your local machine with the denpendency installed, or run it on Google Colab. 

If running on Colab, you need to upload the DATASET.zip to google drive. And uncomment the #!unzip ./gdrive/MyDrive/DATASET.zip in 3rd code block.
